# NoLostPhone
NEW REBBLE LINK (Works in all months but September):
https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5a627fb80dfc322b45002073?query=NoLostPhone&section=watchfaces

NOTE: There is a bug in the Month of September and the day of the month is not visible. I would like to do a release, but I didn't properly connect my Pebble account to Rebble before Fitbit shut the servers down.

The bug is fixed in the `build/NoLostPhone.pbw` that I am pushing to Github, but it will need to be side loaded to your device. See [this article](https://www.guidingtech.com/sideload-apps-pebble-smartwatch/) for instructions.
